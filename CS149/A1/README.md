This is a program which implements the missing matrix operations. 
It takes 3 arguments, A W and B(4 including the program itself) and 
returns R. R = A * W + B. If the matrices are incomplete, they are 
autofilled with 0's in its place. For simplicity assume the array  
dimensions are fixed at: A is 1x3, W is 3x5, B is 1x5. Thus, the result 
R is of dimension 1x5. Any values not within the predeterimined matrix 
dimensions will be ignored.
